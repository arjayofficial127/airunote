description: MODE: VIBE - Rapid feature development mode with strict architectural integrity preservation
---

# MODE: VIBE

## Purpose
Allow rapid feature development ("vibe coding") while preserving strict architectural integrity.

This mode MUST respect all existing architectural constraints and may not override core system boundaries.

---

## MODE: VIBE — PERMISSIONS

When MODE: VIBE is active, you MAY:

1. Create or modify UI components.
2. Implement small CRUD endpoints.
3. Add hooks related to a specific feature.
4. Create isolated utility functions.
5. Add navigation items.
6. Implement missing backend route handlers.
7. Add safe type guards.
8. Add new fields to API responses (without removing existing ones).
9. Add minimal validation logic.

---

## MODE: VIBE — STRICT PROTECTIONS

When MODE: VIBE is active, you MUST NOT:

1. Modify DI container bindings.
2. Modify repository interfaces.
3. Change middleware contracts.
4. Alter authentication flow.
5. Alter multi-tenant org boundary logic.
6. Move files across architectural layers.
7. Change public API response shapes.
8. Remove existing fields from API responses.
9. Introduce new abstraction layers.
10. Introduce new global providers or context layers.
11. Modify tsconfig.json, next.config.js, package.json.
12. Modify database schema.
13. Refactor unrelated code.
14. Modify more than 3 files unless explicitly instructed.
15. Introduce "temporary" TODO patches.
16. Change dependency versions.
17. Bypass architectural layers.
18. Import infrastructure implementation directly into API or UI layers.
19. Perform stylistic or formatting refactors outside the requested scope.

## ARCHITECTURAL LAYER ENFORCEMENT

This system uses strict layers:

```
Frontend
  ↓
API Routes
  ↓
Application Layer
  ↓
Repository Interfaces
  ↓
Infrastructure Implementation
  ↓
Database
```

### Rules:

- **Never skip layers.**
- **Never call infrastructure directly from UI.**
- **Never import repository implementation in UI.**
- **API routes may depend on application layer, not infra.**
- **Application layer depends only on interfaces.**

---

## FILE CHANGE LIMIT

Under MODE: VIBE:

- Limit modifications to files directly involved in the feature.
- **Maximum 3 files changed** unless explicitly approved.
- If more files are required, **STOP and explain why**.

---

## IF ARCHITECTURAL RISK IS DETECTED

If a requested change risks violating architecture:

1. **STOP.**
2. **Explain the architectural risk.**
3. **Suggest a compliant alternative.**
4. **Do not proceed automatically.**

---

## REPORTING REQUIREMENT

When MODE: VIBE is active, after each change:

Provide:
1. **Files modified** (list with paths)
2. **Why each file needed modification** (brief explanation)
3. **Confirmation that architectural boundaries were preserved** (explicit statement)

---

## COEXISTENCE WITH EXISTING RULES

This MODE: VIBE must coexist with existing rules in [CURSOR_RULES.md](mdc:_tools/CURSOR_RULES/CURSOR_RULES.md).

It does NOT override protection constraints, including:
- NON-NEGOTIABLE LAW (SOLID, DRY, Type Safety, Null Discipline, etc.)
- Security by Default
- Repo Discipline
- File Size & Composition Discipline
- PRE-FLIGHT CHECK requirements
- All other existing architectural principles

---

## ACTIVATION

MODE: VIBE is activated when the user explicitly declares:
- `MODE: VIBE`
- Or similar unambiguous directive indicating rapid development mode

If MODE is ambiguous:
- **STOP**
- **Ask the user to declare MODE explicitly**
- **Do NOT infer intent or proceed conditionally**
